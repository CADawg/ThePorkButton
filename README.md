## How to use

#### Step 1: Include the script at the bottom of your site (just before the closing body tag)
```html
<script src="https://kodomains.net/porkbutton/porkbutton.min.js"></script>

#### Step 2: Go Wild!

Every PorkButton must have the class "porkbutton" and the attribute "data-tld" with the domain you want to embed.

```html
<div class="porkbutton" data-tld="3dom"></div>
```

Other options are:

`data-newtab`: Open the search in a new tab

`data-exampletext`: Text to show in the search box by default (excluding tld)

`data-disablecredit`: Disable the credit link

```html
<div class="porkbutton" data-tld="3dom" data-newtab="true" data-exampletext="ibuy" data-disablecredit="true"></div>
```
